Title: Infinite Scrolling World
## Description
On the deployment website, there is a infinite scrolling plane with either non-filled or filled tiles. Tiles are clickable and coordinates will be shown if the mouse is hover on a tile. There will be a shape sign informing that the tile is clicked. On the other hand, the tile can be unclicked if the player changes his/her mind.
## Artistic Statement
There are four different themes of scrolling plan around the origin, one with fully filling tiles, one with all non-filled tiles, and two with different style filling tiles. There are three shape signs showing that the tile is clicked, triangles, circles and squares.
